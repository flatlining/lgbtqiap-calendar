## Information

The current version is a 1:1 version of the original source, some date are local to Brazil and some date don't have a reference to support them. The ideia in the future is to create country specific versions and or to create a global one inspired by the [List of LGBT awareness days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LGBT_awareness_days) article.
